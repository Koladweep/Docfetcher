The various Chinese translations (language code zh and zh_*) are mostly
duplicates. There are actually only two non-duplicate Chinese translations:
Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese. The former is dominant in China
(zh_CN) and Singapore (zh_SG), and the latter is dominant in Hong Kong (zh_HK)
and Taiwan (zh_TW). In addition, DocFetcher uses Simplified Chinese as fallback
in case of an unexpected country code, e.g., zh_US. Consequently, the following
folders are duplicates:
- zh, zh_CN, zh_SG
- zh_HK, zh_TW
